# Logo Maker

## Description
 The motive of this was for me to save extra time when trying to create a logo.
 I built this project for the sake of time efficiency.
 This project was a great test for me. It got me familiar with how to use jest and run tests.

 ## Installation 
 To download or use this application go to my GitHub, and clone it to one of your repo's.

 ## Usage
