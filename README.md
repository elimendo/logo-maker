# Logo Maker

## Description
 The motive of this was for me to save extra time when trying to create a logo.
 I built this project for the sake of time efficiency.
 This project was a great test for me. It got me familiar with how to use jest and run tests.

 ## Installation 
 To download or use this application goto my github, and clone it to one of your repos.

 ## Usage
 This application is great if you need a simple but clean logo efficiently. The possibilities are endless! Get creative mix and math words, get quirky and spell cat with a pink  triangle background!
